Suffix Arrays and Longest Common Prefix

Note: We are guaranteeing that each line is of equal length.

Given a string find for k = 2, 3, ..., 10, what is the longest string that occurs k times? 
Note: if the input is aaaaa, the longest string that occurs twice is aaaa

For example, if this input file is:

```sh
AAAB
AABA
ABBB
```

Output would look something like

```sh
Longest sequence that occurs 2 times has basic length 6 and is AABAAB
Occurrence #1 starts at line 1
Occurrence #2 starts at line 2

Longest sequence that occurs 3 times has basic length 3 and is AAB
Occurrence #1 starts at line 1
Occurrence #2 starts at line 2
Occurrence #3 starts at line 2
