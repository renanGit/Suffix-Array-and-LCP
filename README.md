Suffix Arrays and Longest Common Prefix

Given a string find for k = 2, 3, ..., 10, what is the longest string that occurs k times? 
Note: if the input is aaaaa, the longest string that occurs twice is aaaa

For example, if this input file is
AAAB
AABA
ABBB


Output would look something like


Longest sequence that occurs 2 times has basic length 6 and is AABAAB
Occurrence #1 starts at line 1
Occurrence #2 starts at line 2

Longest sequence that occurs 3 times has basic length 3 and is AAB
Occurrence #1 starts at line 1
Occurrence #2 starts at line 2
Occurrence #3 starts at line 2
